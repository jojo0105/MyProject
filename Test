After all the team is able to write changes and retrieve other members’ changes, we’ll go to the conflict practice. 
A conflict will occur if you try to push to the remote repository, but your changes are based in an older version 
than what is currently online. If you are working by yourself, you can still perform this practice by cloning the 
repository in different locations in your filesystem. You will have 2 different local repositories, that will behave 
just as if they were two clones by different users, so conflicts between the local repositories will occur in the same way.
For instance, suppose the code online is on version 1.0. Everyone in the team has the same version in their local 
repository. Now two members of the team start making local changes at the same time,without communicating with the 
other. When the first one pushes to the repository it will work fine,since the next version (1.1) was created based 
on the 1.0 which is online. Now, when the second.
